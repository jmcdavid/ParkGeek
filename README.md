# National Park Geek (with weather updates)
This project was done during my Tech Elevator bootcamp in the Autumn of 2019. This was my favorite project because it was the first time I was able to work side by side with my partner Christian, doing dual programming. It was our first time dealing with git pushing and pulling with another programmer and avoiding merge conflicts. 

After installing the SQL database you can run the parkgeek app and go through all the parks, then vote on your favorite.
