# National Park Geek (with weather updates)
This project was done during my Tech Elevator bootcamp in the Autumn of 2019. This was my favorite project because it was the first time I was able to work side by side with my partner Christian, doing dual programming. It was our first time dealing with git pushing and pulling with another programmer and avoiding merge conflicts. 

After installing the SQL database you can run the parkgeek app and go through all the parks, then vote on your favorite.

The most challenging part of this project was adding the converter from F to C and vice versa. We were able to do the calculations in code to add the button to easily convert.
challenge came when we realized that the weather warnings didn't convert along with it. It was a learning experience though that mocked the real life situations we'll face in 
the workplace.
